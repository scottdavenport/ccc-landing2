# Sponsor Website Field

## Overview
This feature adds an optional website field to sponsors in the system. This allows administrators to store and display the website URL for each sponsor, enabling visitors to easily access sponsor websites directly from the CCC Landing Page.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- Added a `website` column to the `api.sponsors` table as a TEXT field
- Migration file: `20250227183244_consolidated_sponsor_website_fix.sql` (consolidated approach)
- Implemented with idempotent SQL to ensure safe application across environments

### UI Changes
- Added a website input field to the Add/Edit Sponsor form
- The field is optional (not required)
- When editing a sponsor, the website field will be pre-populated if available
- Added URL validation to ensure proper website format

### Type Changes
- Updated the `SponsorWithLevel` type to include the optional `website` property
- Added TypeScript validation for website URLs

## Usage
Administrators can now enter a website URL when adding or editing sponsors. This field is optional and can be left blank. When provided, the website will be displayed on the sponsor's profile and can be clicked to visit the sponsor's website.

## Migration Strategy
We've implemented a robust migration strategy to ensure consistent database schema across environments:

1. **Consolidated Migration**: Created a single consolidated migration file that:
   - Adds the website column if it doesn't exist
   - Sets appropriate permissions
   - Ensures RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Repairs migration history if needed

2. **Idempotent Design**: The migration is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors or changing the result beyond the first application.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with robust error handling to ensure migrations are applied correctly across environments.

## Benefits
- Improved sponsor visibility and value proposition
- Enhanced user experience by providing direct links to sponsor websites
- Better sponsor information management for administrators
- Consistent database schema across all environments
