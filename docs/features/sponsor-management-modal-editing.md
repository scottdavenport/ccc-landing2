# Sponsor Management Modal Editing

## Overview
This feature enhances the sponsor management interface by replacing the inline editing functionality with a modal-based editing approach. When users click on a row in the sponsors table (excluding Logo and Actions columns), the Add Sponsor modal opens pre-filled with the selected sponsor's data for editing.

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **SponsorsTable.tsx**
   - Added `onEditSponsor` prop to handle sponsor editing
   - Implemented `handleRowClick` function to detect row clicks
   - Added logic to ignore clicks on Logo and Actions columns
   - Connected the DataGrid's `onCellClick` event to the handler

2. **AddSponsorDialog.tsx**
   - Added `sponsorToEdit` prop to receive sponsor data
   - Added dynamic title that changes based on whether adding or editing
   - Passes sponsor data to the form component

3. **AddSponsorForm.tsx**
   - Added `sponsorToEdit` prop to receive sponsor data
   - Added `isEditMode` state to track editing vs. adding mode
   - Updated form initialization to populate fields with existing data
   - Modified submit handler to perform either update or insert based on mode
   - Updated success message and button text based on mode

4. **Admin Page**
   - Added state to track the selected sponsor
   - Added handler for editing sponsors
   - Updated dialog close handler to reset selected sponsor

## User Experience
- Users can now click anywhere on a sponsor row to edit it
- The same form is used for both adding and editing sponsors
- Clear visual indicators show whether adding or editing (form title and button text)
- Success messages are contextual based on the operation performed

## Technical Notes
- The form maintains the same validation and error handling for both modes
- Cloudinary image handling works for both new uploads and updates
- Data is refreshed after successful operations to show the latest changes

## Future Improvements
- Add confirmation when canceling edits with unsaved changes
- Implement optimistic UI updates to avoid full page reloads
- Add form field validation with real-time feedback
