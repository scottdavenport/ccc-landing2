# Delete Confirmation Feature

## Overview
This feature adds a confirmation dialog whenever a user attempts to delete a sponsor record. This prevents accidental data deletion and provides an additional safety check before removing data from the database.

## Implementation Details

### Individual Delete Confirmation
- Added a confirmation dialog that appears when a user clicks the trash icon for an individual sponsor
- The dialog asks for confirmation and warns that the action cannot be undone
- User must explicitly click "Delete" to confirm the deletion or "Cancel" to abort
- Implemented using the AlertDialog component from the UI library

### Technical Changes
1. Added a new state variable `singleDeleteId` to track which sponsor is being deleted
2. Modified the trash icon click handler to set this ID instead of directly deleting
3. Added a new AlertDialog component specifically for individual deletions
4. Updated the `handleDelete` function to clear the `singleDeleteId` after deletion

## User Experience
- Users now have a clear confirmation step before data is deleted
- The confirmation dialog clearly communicates that the action is permanent
- Consistent with the existing bulk deletion confirmation UI

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding the sponsor name in the confirmation dialog for clearer context
- Add animation to make the confirmation dialog more noticeable
