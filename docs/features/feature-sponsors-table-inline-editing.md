# Sponsors Table Inline Editing

## Overview

The Sponsors Table Inline Editing feature allows administrators to edit sponsor information directly within the table interface without the need for separate edit forms or modals. This provides a more efficient and intuitive editing experience.

## Implementation Details

### Editable Fields

The following fields can be edited inline:

- **Name**: Text input for editing the sponsor's name
- **Level**: Dropdown selection for choosing the sponsor's level
- **Year**: Dropdown selection for choosing the sponsor's year

### Editing Process

1. **Activation**: Editing is triggered by clicking on a cell in the table
2. **Input Display**: The cell content is replaced with an appropriate input element:
   - Text input for name
   - Dropdown for level and year
3. **Save Mechanism**: Changes are saved when:
   - The user presses Enter
   - The user selects an option from a dropdown
   - The user clicks outside the editing cell

### Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Uses React state and refs to track editing state and values
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - Memoized components and callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Used refs for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders
  - Properly managed dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback hooks
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately saved to the Supabase database
- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - Smooth transitions between view and edit modes
  - Intuitive dropdown behavior for selecting options
  - Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## User Experience

- **Minimal UI Clutter**: No additional buttons or icons for editing
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Simply click to edit
- **Immediate Feedback**: Changes are reflected in the UI immediately upon save
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

## Dependencies

- React 19
- Next.js
- Supabase
- MUI DataGrid
- Radix UI components

## Future Enhancements

- Add inline editing for additional fields
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add validation for input fields
- Support for batch editing multiple sponsors

## Bug Fixes

### Null Checks for Sponsor Levels

- Added proper null checks when accessing `sponsor_levels` property
- Fixed TypeError that occurred when a sponsor didn't have an associated level
- Implemented defensive programming approach for all data access in table cells
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases when data might be undefined
