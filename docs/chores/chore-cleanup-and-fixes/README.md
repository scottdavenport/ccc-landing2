# Cleanup and Fixes Chore

## Overview
This chore addresses various cleanup tasks and minor fixes across the codebase to improve stability and maintainability.

## Changes

### 1. ConnectionStatus Component Fix
- Fixed potential null reference error in ConnectionStatus component
- Changed lastChecked state to be nullable (Date | null)
- Added proper null handling in the UI
- Improved initial loading state with "Checking..." message

### 2. File Cleanup
- Removed duplicate files:
  - SponsorLogoDialog 2.tsx
  - dialog 2.tsx
  - feature-eslint-config 2.md
  - playwright-report/index 2.html
- Cleaned up deleted playwright report files and images

## Technical Details

### ConnectionStatus Changes
```diff
- const [lastChecked, setLastChecked] = useState<Date>(new Date());
+ const [lastChecked, setLastChecked] = useState<Date | null>(null);

- title={`Last checked: ${lastChecked.toLocaleTimeString()}`}
+ title={lastChecked ? `Last checked: ${lastChecked.toLocaleTimeString()}` : 'Checking...'}
```

### File Organization
- Removed duplicate files that were likely created during merges or file moves
- Maintained proper file structure in components and docs directories

## Testing
1. Verify ConnectionStatus component shows proper loading state
2. Confirm no functionality is broken by file cleanup
3. Check that all features still work after duplicate file removal
