# Dependency Fixes

## Missing Dependencies Fix - February 2025

Added missing dependencies required for the build process:

- `postcss-nested`: Required for TailwindCSS processing
- `whatwg-url`: Required for Supabase client
- `lodash`: Required for Cloudinary integration
- `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`: Required for UI checkbox component

### Impact
These dependencies were causing build failures in:
- Font loading with next/font
- Supabase client initialization
- Cloudinary API integration
- UI components (checkbox)

### Resolution
Added the missing dependencies to package.json and ensured they are properly installed.
